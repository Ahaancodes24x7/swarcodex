🧠 SWAR – Voice-First AI Platform for Learning Difficulty Screening

(Dyslexia · Dyscalculia · Dysgraphia)

📌 Overview

SWAR is a voice-first, AI-powered screening and analysis platform designed to identify, analyze, and flag early indicators of learning difficulties such as Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, and Dysgraphia.

The platform combines speech recognition, machine learning, computer vision, and cognitive analytics to generate detailed, explainable, and educator-friendly reports — while maintaining ethical boundaries by acting as a screening and decision-support tool, not a medical diagnosis system.

SWAR is built to be:

Accessible

Multilingual

Explainable

Scalable

Classroom-ready

🎯 Core Philosophy

Early flagging + Explainable AI + Inclusive design

SWAR focuses on:

Early detection, not diagnosis

Explainability over black-box predictions

Multimodal assessment (voice + written + visual)

Gamified, stress-free testing environments

🧩 Assessment Modes in SWAR

SWAR offers multiple assessment pathways, allowing flexibility based on student comfort, age, and accessibility needs.

🎙️ 1. Voice-First Assessment (Primary Mode)

This is SWAR’s flagship feature.

🔹 Workflow:

Student responds verbally to guided reading and phonetic tasks

Google Speech-to-Text API converts speech into text

The system computes:

Phonematic / phonemic error rate

Substitution, omission, reversal, and blending errors

A custom ML pipeline analyzes speech patterns

SWAR generates a detailed AI-driven cognitive report

🔹 Key Metrics Analyzed:

Phoneme substitution patterns

Mispronunciation frequency

Reading speed vs accuracy

Hesitation and response latency

Error clustering and consistency

🔹 Targeted Conditions:

Dyslexia

Dyscalculia (verbal number reasoning)

✍️ 2. Written Assessment Mode

Designed for students who prefer or require non-verbal testing.

🔹 Dyslexia (Written)

Phoneme-grapheme mapping

Letter-sound correspondence analysis

Word reversal and sequencing checks

Error distribution visualization using phoneme graphing

🔹 Dysgraphia (Written)

Handwriting or written-response analysis

CNN-based model evaluates:

Letter formation

Stroke consistency

Spatial alignment

Writing pressure / structure (where available)

🔹 Dyscalculia (Written)

Number sense evaluation

Symbol-quantity mismatch detection

Step-wise problem solving analysis

Arithmetic error classification

🎮 3. Gamified Assessment Mode

To reduce anxiety and improve engagement, SWAR includes game-based cognitive tests.

🔹 Features:

Reading games

Number puzzles

Pattern recognition tasks

Memory and sequencing challenges

🔹 Benefits:

Natural behavior capture

Reduced performance pressure

Better data quality for ML models

🧠 AI & ML Architecture
🔹 Speech Recognition

Google Speech-to-Text API

High-accuracy multilingual speech transcription

Robust handling of child speech and accents

🔹 Feature Engineering (Core Intelligence)

SWAR extracts 20+ cognitive and behavioral features, including:

Reading speed and fatigue trends

Accuracy and consistency metrics

Phonological awareness indicators

Response time variance

Cognitive load estimation

Working memory proxies

🔹 ML Models Used
Condition	Model Type
Dyslexia	Neural-inspired, feature-engineered risk model
Dysgraphia	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Dyscalculia	Rule-based + ML hybrid (numeric cognition features)

⚠️ Models are designed for screening and explainability, not medical diagnosis.
